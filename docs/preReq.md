# Pre-Requisites

In order to develop React applications, there are a few things that you need to install. You will also see create-react-app listed here. We will use this to set up a 'proper' React project that we will use throughout this tutorial.

## List of pre-requisites

First, some definitions -- and what we use these tools for.

### NodeJS

Wikipedia definition

> Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.

[NodeJS Download Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### NPM

> NPM - Node Package Manager is how you install packages from the NPM registry. Installing React, or other 'helpful' open source packages is done via NPM. NPM is installed as part of the NodeJS download/install.

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

The choice of an IDE is purely personal. All of the tutorials/examples in this tutorial were created using VSCode. I use it commercially.

VSCode can be downloaded [HERE](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

### React and Supporting Packages

Installing React is done via NPM. We'll see how when we create our app for this tutorial.

For now, install NodeJS (which installs NPM)
